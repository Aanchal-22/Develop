                            This application is hosted on a U.S.-based server and may not be used in connection with any transaction involving a “sanctioned” country.
                            Use of a U.S.-based application for transactions involving sanctioned countries could be considered “facilitation” of trade with the sanctioned country, which is prohibited by U.S. law.

                            Accessing technical data or engineering tools hosted on a U.S.-based application or server from outside the U.S. is considered an export of that technical data or engineering tool.
                            It is your obligation to comply with all relevant U.S. export laws, including restricting access to technical data or on-line engineering systems, applications or tools which have been designated as “export controlled” by the business.
                            For questions related to the proper classification of GE technology, equipment, and software, contact the applicable businesses' Chief Engineer's Office.
                            For questions on compliance with US export laws, contact either your businesses’ International Trade Controls Administrator (Gwen Cole for Energy and Oil & Gas) or assigned counsel.
